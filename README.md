## Course Description

This course highlights the research in analysis for social data and social media and builds skills to undertake those analyses. It is intended to build up data analytic skills for novice and intermediate researchers. We start with an understanding of “social capital”, then proceed with a practice of social data management and then finish with some discussions around social data topics. As such the course entails reviews of studies using "big data", critiques of data analytics and questions surrounding social data ethics as well as social data in political mobilization. We also learn Python as a programming language, that is how to scrape social data, store and collect it, run basic statistics, generate visuals, and create reports based on a project of interest and case studies. 

In lecture, we focus on both theoretical principles of social capital, social data analysis, on coding principles, and examples of social data analysis. This is also lab-oriented, that is we apply the knowledge learned in lectures and we complete quizzes as well as projects and case studies.  
By the end of this course, students should be able to: 
1.	Understand the “social capital” and how it operates within the social world
2.	Identify potential social data sources to answer some social scientific questions
3.	Collect data sources for use in analysis
4.	Transform data into a usable format
5.	Analyze data using standard social scientific methods
6.	Visualize data in informative ways


## Course Requirements and Criteria

**Syllabus**

Students should check the syllabus for deadlines and for course requirements. They are expected to read and understand it, and where necessary ask the lecturer or teaching assistant for specifics.

**Attendance**

Attendance in this class is mandatory. Classes are the primary space where we cover materials on theoretical concepts, on practical tests and on thematic discussions. 

**Reading**

There are no textbooks required for this course. All required readings are posted to the UofT Learning Portal under Library Reserves (and on this website). For each week and where applied, there is a list of required readings and some other recommended. Readings should be completed before the date listed in the semester schedule. Students should view the readings as supplements to the work of understanding and learning the concepts involved in social data and in programming methods. 

**Quizzes**

There will be 10 quizzes (worth 4% each and 40% overall) that cover readings and lab activities. Quizzes will be from September 21st to November 2nd included.

**Project of interest (Social data)**

The course is oriented such that students can design and execute research projects concerning questions of their choosing. Early on, students choose a project to work on, which they submit about a short abstract and statement of problem. It then leads to its execution. Students describe their project in full as they contain all graphs, figures, and correct citations. They also submit the code and the data they have been using. Projects of interests are individual. 

**Case study (Social media)**

The case study is an opportunity to work on a social data / media question / problem linked to an organization, be it a private firm, a public agency, a non-profit or a startup company. The work follows the Social Media Optimization Method (MOMS©) that articulates an abstract, the statement of the problem, a diagnostic, a set of recommendations and a synthesis of the case study. The social media case study defines itself as a real-world application of the theoretical concepts, and the tools studied during the session. 

The case study comprises a strategic report and an exposé. The report is a written document that is inclusive of all the parts required elements of analysis and recommendations that compose the method whereas the exposé is the oral presentation of the same case study to the whole class. The logic here being to offer an opportunity of co-learning from the variety of cases and experiences that will be presented. Social media case studies are in group of 2. 

**Exam**

There is no exam.

## Teaching methods 

The course comprises lectures on theoretical concepts of social capital, social data and social media as well as practice of social data / media management. A third part of the method is made of animated discussions on topics that relate to ethics and political mobilization in the context of social data / media. Overall, the teaching philosophy articulates theoretical knowledge, case studies and open discussions.


## Procedures and rules

**E-Culture Policy**

Only student U of T email accounts should be used for course communication and emails from students must include the course code in the subject line and should be signed with the full student name and student number.

In lab, we will be using computers throughout class. There's always the temptation to use computers for one’s own personal tasks or entertainment. However, lab time is limited specifically for instruction. It would behoove the students to use class time for following the lab assignment. Likewise, it is the students’ responsibility to read their U of T email on a regular basis. This will ensure that they receive important information from the instructor.

**Learning Technology**

This course takes the students into theoretical knowledge, computer programming and open discussions. There are a many resources out there for programming, especially programming in Python. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the website Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/) to find some answers to specific programming questions. These communities have a set of banks of answers to the most common programming questions. However, students make sure that they are not just copying and pasting code they find on the web. This would be a violation of academic integrity. 
Students submit all assignments and components of the report through the UofT online Learning Portal.

**Late assignments, Extensions**

**A. Late Penalties**

Students are expected to complete assignments on time. There will be a penalty for lateness of 10% deducted per day and work that is not handed in one week after the due date will not be accepted.

**B. Requesting an Extension**

If students require more time to complete term work they should contact their instructor immediately in writing (email is acceptable), and ideally well before the due date. Extensions up to one week past the original due date may be granted. Students who fail to submit the late work by the new due date will have 10% per day applied to their work when it is finally submitted.

A Special Consideration Form explaining the reason for the extension request must be submitted to Academic Advisor, Rose Antonio (CCT3018), with original supporting documentation (e.g. U of T Verification of Student Illness or Injury, accident report, death certificate or other documentation confirming non-medical extenuating circumstances), no later than 72 hours after the due date.

Students should note that holidays, family plans or trips (unless critical in nature), lack of preparation, poor time budgeting or scheduling conflicts with outside work and other courses, are not acceptable reasons for an extension. Should students have a compelling reason to request an extension outside of documented contingencies, their request may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. Such accommodations are more likely to be granted if they are done well before the assignment due date.

In addition, students are required to declare any absence on ACORN on the day of their absence (or by the day after, at the latest) to receive academic accommodation. Absences include those due to illness, death in the family, religious accommodation or other circumstances beyond their control.

**C. Documentation**

The Verification of Student Illness or Injury form and Special Consideration Form are available at https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/iccit/students/forms.

The Verification of Student Illness or Injury form must be completed by a Licensed Practitioner based on examination and applicable documented history at the time of illness or injury, not after the fact. Completion of this form does not guarantee that special consideration will be granted. Incomplete forms will not be processed. In some appeal situations, the University may require additional information from you or your practitioner to decide whether to grant or confirm special consideration. If you have questions about the Verification of Student Illness or Injury form, please visit http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/.


**Re-marking Pieces of Term Work**

**General**

A student who believes that his or her written term work has been unfairly marked may ask the person who marked the work for re-evaluation. Students have up to one month from the date of return of an item of term work or from the date the mark was made available to inquire about the mark and file for an appeal. For example, should the work be returned or the mark be made available on March 3rd, the student has until April 3rd to inquire in writing and start the re-marking process. Instructors must acknowledge receipt of a student request for re-marking within 3-working days, and decisions should be provided in a timely fashion.

If an academic misconduct case is in progress for the piece of term work in question, a student may not appeal until the matter is resolved. 

Regrade requests for term work worth less than 20% of the final mark may be submitted to the person who marked the work for re-evaluation. The student must submit (1) the original piece of work and (2) a written explanation detailing why they believe the work was unfairly/incorrectly marked. If the student is not satisfied with this re-evaluation, he or she may appeal to the instructor in charge of the course if the work was not marked by the instructor (e.g., was marked by a TA). In these instances where the instructor was not the one who marked the work, the student must now submit to the instructor (1) the original piece of work, (2) the written reasons as to why he or she believes the work was unfairly/incorrectly marked, and (3) communications from the original marker as to why no change in mark was made. If a re-marking is granted by an instructor, the student must accept the resulting mark as the new mark, whether it goes up or down or remains the same. Continuing with the remark or the appeal means the student accepts this condition. Instructors and TAs should ensure all communication with the student is in writing (e.g. follow-up email) and keep a copy for later reference. 

Only term work worth at least 20% of the course mark may be appealed beyond the instructor. Such appeals must first follow the same guidelines as those mentioned directly above for work worth less than 20%. To escalate an appeal beyond the instructor, the student must submit to the department (1) all previous communications between the student, original marker, and the instructor (2) the detailed reason(s) documenting why the mark for the work was inappropriate and (3) the original piece of work. If the department believes that re-marking is justified, the department shall select an independent reader. The student must agree in writing to be bound by the results of the re-reading process or abandon the appeal. Again, the student must accept that the mark resulting from the appeal may be higher or lower or the same as the original mark. Where possible, the independent reader should be given a clean, anonymous copy of the work. Without knowing the original assigned mark, the reader shall determine a mark for the work. The marking of the work should be considered within the context of the course of instruction for which it was submitted. If the new mark differs substantially from the original mark, the department shall determine a final mark taking into account both available marks. 

The final level of appeal is to the Dean's Office. Appeals must already have been considered at the two previous levels (Instructor followed by Department), with the decision reviewed by the head of the academic unit, before they will be considered by the Dean’s Office. Appeals must be submitted in writing, and include all previous correspondence, as soon as possible after the student receives the final response from the academic unit, but no later than one month after. Appeals to the Dean’s Office about the marking of term work will be reviewed to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed in earlier appeals, that the student has been treated fairly, and that the standards applied have been consistent with those applied to other students doing the assignment. Any mark resulting from such an appeal will become the new mark, whether it is higher or lower or the same as the previous one. This process applies only to term work; appeals for re-reads of final examinations are handled directly by the Office of the Registrar. 

**Issues Pertaining to Term Work and Instructional Activities**

Issues arising within a course that concern the pedagogical relationship of the instructor and the student, such as essays, term work, term tests, grading practices, or conduct of instructors, fall within the authority of the department. Students are entitled to seek resolution of these issues, either orally or in writing to the course instructor and, if needed, the ICCIT Director for resolution.
Following a response from the ICCIT Director, students may submit an appeal, in writing, to the Vice-Principal, Academic and Dean.

**Missed Term Tests and Quizzes**

**A. Missed Term Tests and Quizzes**

Students who miss a term test/quiz will be assigned a mark of zero for that test/quiz unless they are granted special consideration.
If the term test/quiz was missed for reasons entirely beyond the student's control, a Special Consideration Form explaining the reason for missing the test/quiz must be submitted to Academic Advisor, Rose Antonio (CCT3018), with original supporting documentation (e.g. U of T Verification of Student Illness or Injury, accident report, death certificate or other documentation confirming non-medical extenuating circumstances), within one week of the missed test. The department will review such requests and students whose requests are approved will be contacted by the instructor.
In addition, students who miss a term test/quiz must declare their absence on ACORN the day of the test/quiz (or by the day after at the latest) in order to receive academic accommodation. Absences include those due to illness, death in the family, religious accommodation or other circumstances beyond their control.

**B. Missed Term Test/Quiz Make-up**

Students will be informed of the make-up date via email once they have received approval from the CCIT Academic Advisor. Students will write the test within 2 weeks of the original test/quiz. While attempts will be made to provide 5-7 days of notice before the test, please note that sometimes it is not possible and students should therefore be prepared for the make-up test/quiz at any time. There is no opportunity to defer a term test/quiz.

**C. Documentation**

The Verification of Student Illness or Injury form and Special Consideration Form are available at https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/iccit/students/forms.
The Verification of Student Illness or Injury form must be completed by a Licensed Practitioner based on examination and applicable documented history at the time of illness or injury, not after the fact. Completion of this form does not guarantee that special consideration will be granted. Incomplete forms will not be processed. In some appeal situations, the University may require additional information from you or your practitioner to decide whether or not to grant or confirm special consideration. If you have questions about the Verification of Student Illness or Injury form, please visit http://www.illnessverification.utoronto.ca/.

**D. Special Consideration Form**

Students are responsible for providing an accurate phone number and email address on your Special Consideration Form. It is their responsibility to obtain the decision from the department. Claims that a departmental decision was not received will not be considered as reason for further consideration.

**Missed Final Exam**

Final examinations are scheduled, administered and governed by the policies set by the Office of the Registrar. Any student that is granted a deferral by the Office of the Registrar will be required to write a deferred examination at the next exam-writing session scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. Students should note that the deferred exam may not follow the same format as the exam given in the regular writing session.

Students who cannot write a final examination due to illness or other serious causes must file an online petition within 72 hours of the missed examination. Original supporting documentation must also be submitted to the Office of the Registrar within 72 hours of the missed exam. Late petitions will NOT be considered. If illness is cited as the reason for a deferred exam request, a U of T Verification of Student Illness or Injury Form must show that you were examined and diagnosed at the time of illness and on the date of the exam, or by the day after at the latest. Students must also record their absence on ROSI on the day of the missed exam or by the day after at the latest. Upon approval of a deferred exam request, a non-refundable fee of $70 is required for each examination approved.

**Academic Integrity**

Academic integrity is essential to the pursuit of learning and scholarship in a university, and to ensuring that a degree from the University of Toronto is a strong signal of each student’s individual academic achievement.
